Menar Muflihi's SQL Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains SQL's ive written for personal projects and further learning. Below is my highlighted project, including data visualizations I created using Tableau.

Highlighted Projects

Number of Visitors to Japan - SQL: In this project, I used a dataset found on Kaggle to analyze trends of Vistors to Japan. Using pitch-class integer notation, I examined the key and tonality for these top songs. I joined data from a Hooktheory database to compare the most popular song keys with the song keys most represented in the top 50 Spotify tracks of 2021.
Predictive Book Ratings Analysis - SQL: In this project, I used my own data from Goodreads to analyze how my book ratings differ from the average ratings found on Goodreads. I categorized the books by genre and obtained the average difference in rating per genre. I created another table containing similar data for books that won the Booker Prize for Fiction from 2000-2021 and joined this data to predict, for each Booker Prize-winning book, what my rating would be.
