Menar Muflihi's SQL Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains SQL's ive written for personal projects and further learning. Below is my highlighted project, including data visualizations I created using Tableau. 

Number of Visitors to Japan Project- SQL: In this project, I found a dataset found on Kaggle to analyze trends of Vistors to Japan. I examined the key and tonality for these top songs. I joined data from a Hooktheory database to compare the most popular song keys with the song keys most represented in the top 50 Spotify tracks of 2021.
