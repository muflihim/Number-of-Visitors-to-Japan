Menar Muflihi's SQL Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains SQL's ive written for personal projects and further learning. Below is my highlighted project, including data visualizations I created using Tableau. 

Number of Visitors to Japan Project-
SQL: In this project, I found a dataset found on Kaggle to analyze trends of Vistors to Japan. I was able to plot the data found within the data set tables. I then began to find the the top 10 countries and bottom 10 countries to travel to Japan. 
Tableau: In this dashboard I was able to use the same data set tables to visualize the trends of foreign travelers to Japan from 1964 to 2023. I used a startegy to show the audience, airline executives, geographical, categorical and seasonal factors that lead travelers to Japan. This dashboard guides my audience to call out the amount of visitors they have had since 1964, who their top visotors are and the time of year they recieve the most visitors.
